# UltraStar Deluxe Editor

This is a tool for editing song information and creating new songs for *UltraStar Deluxe*. With the editor you can not only edit the **metadata** and **text** of your song. It's also possible to change the **cover image**, **MP3** file and **music video** of your songs.

You can **create new songs** or import the `.txt`-files to add them to UltraStar Deluxe. When you're done creating your new songs you can use the export function to **export** the song file to a location of your choosing to share it online. 

Thanks to the list view on the left side of the editor which shows every song located in one of your song directories, you can see at a glance which songs are currently **playable** and which ones aren't.
